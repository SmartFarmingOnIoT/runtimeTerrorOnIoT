# Documentation of runtimeTerrorOnIoT Web App
TEAM: RuntimeTerrorOnIoT
Team Number : 38

This is a web app to monitor various key factors in a plantation such as Temperature (of the atmosphere), Humidity (of the atmosphere), Light intensity, Soil Moisture levels, Gas levels (presence of harmful gases such as Methane, etc.

Click [here](https://smartfarmingoniot.github.io/runtimeTerrorOnIoT/) to get redirected to the implementation website. 
There, you can view the live feed of the data being sent from the Arduino Nano IoT device and it's visualisation in graphs. There is a control button to turn the water pump ON and OFF should the user wish to do so.

Since the implementation of the same was locally hosted, it is not possibe to visualise the same through the above implementation link.

# Planned additions:
* Addition of an automation system to automatically trigger the motor pump on detection of soil moisture falling below a threshold level.
* Addition of sensors to sense the gases present in atmosphere, in turn advising changes in fertilizations behaviours to control air      pollution, thus preventing Global Warming, for a better Climatic condition.
